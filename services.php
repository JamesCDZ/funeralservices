With this in mind, we give you the opportunity to plan it and even pay for it in advance with our independent contacts. This gives you the chance to work out exactly what you want well in advance, leaving your loved ones with nothing to organise when you pass away. This can make things much easier for them, and you can have the peace of mind that you have done everything possible to help. Contact us to see what we can help you with.</span>

              <p>
                <span style="color: rgb(47, 57, 65);">It is no secret that the cost of funerals can add up, and this is even more likely to be the case if you have specific requirements or unusual requests about what you might want for the service itself. You might be concerned about how your loved ones are going to be able to afford this, however with pre-paid funerals you have the chance to put the funds in place ready for when they are needed. We can guide you with information about excellent payment plans for you to spread the cost and advise that not all funeral plans are the same, we would strongly advise against funeral plans that are ‘towards’ your funeral costs. Contact us and we can discuss what options are available.</span>
