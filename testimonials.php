I would like to thank David Armstrong for conducting the service and making it feel very personal. We will toast him later with his favourite tipple, a large port and lemonade and when we can we will indulge in his favourite fish, chips and peas in Matlock. We are all feeling the loss at present, it actually feels real today with not seeing him for six weeks it was hard to take in that he had gone.&quot;</div>

            <div>&quot;Hi Karen &amp; Dave, we as a family just wanted to send this email to you to say such a big ‘THANK YOU’ for your assistance at the funeral of Charles Tomlinson on Friday 21st February. The wheelchair access vehicle service to ensure that my mum got to attend was down to you. She got the opportunity to be able to attend the service and afterwards at the Tea Rooms to meet family and friends. You went the extra mile and transported mum back to the hospital making the hassle of booking a taxi disappear. Your services are invaluable to families at this awful time. Once again thank you.&quot;</div>

I am the Wednesday fan, forever banished to Leicestershire. I just wanted to say a massive THANK YOU - as your kindness, skill and humour made such a huge difference to me and my family on the day - especially my Mum, Carol. What you and the rest of the bike guys do is fantastic, and I am sure appreciated by all of the people you give your time up for. We are so very grateful, and as a biker of many years I was really proud of Uncle Collin&#039;s final journey - as he would have been. If you are able, please also pass on my very best regards to Steve the next time you see him - another gentleman, who showed great kindness to my Mum. Kind regards and best wishes.”</div>
